# Repository For Families Front End

This read me discusses the front end implementation only. To read about what the project is see 
the read me for the [backend](https://github.com/santamarina919/RepositoryForFamilies-Backend). 

## What was used to implement it?
Angular 19 was used to develop the front end of RFF. Why? It was mainly chosen as a learning experience.
I've used Next.js and plain html,css and js to build applications so I chose angular to learn something you.
