# Repository For Families Front End

This read me discusses the front end implementation only. To read about what the project is see 
the read me for the [backend](https://github.com/santamarina919/RepositoryForFamilies-Backend). 

## What was used to implement it?
Angular 19 was used to develop the front end of RFF. Why? It was mainly chosen as a learning experience.
I've used Next.js and plain html,css and js to build applications so I chose angular to learn something you.

#### Note: This project is ongoing, and I am continuously adding features to this project.

## What features are implemented?

* ## Users
User can sign up and log in using two simple forms.
The sign-up form asks for email,password, first name and last name.


<br>
The login form asks for a username and password.

* ## Groups

Users can join any number of groups. After they sign into the application they are presented with a list of groups 
that they are a part of. The user chooses which group they want to view currently. The user can also chose to create a new group or
join one. If they chose to create a group they only need to provide a name. If they chose to join a group then they 
must know what they group id is and provide it. 

* ## Events 

Events are presented to the user as a list seperated by the date on which they are going to occur.
